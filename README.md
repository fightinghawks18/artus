# Artus
Artus is a C++ engine that focuses on being a cross-platform solution for making games/applications on desktop.

## What is planned?
Aside from Artus being cross-platform there are many other goals to be met:
* Modding: Either a custom-built language *(similar to TorqueScript syntax)*, or a third-party language *(Lua, Wren, Squirrel, etc...)* 
* Networking: Native sockets or third-party solutions?
* VR: OpenXR support

### THERE IS MORE TO BE ADDED HERE... BUT THE PROJECT IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT
